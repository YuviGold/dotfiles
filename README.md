# Dotfiles

Ok I had enough of installing all my tools, and configurations getting lost
So.. why not to have a git repo? :)


## Notes

- Must restart GNOME (`ALT + F2`) for the GNOME extensions to take place.
- Must restart the user session (log out and log in) for `ZSH` to run.

## Test

I use [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) tool to run the Git Hub Action locally
